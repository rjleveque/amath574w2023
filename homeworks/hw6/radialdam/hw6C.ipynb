    "\n",
    "This is part of Homework 6.  Due by 11:00pm on March 10, 2023\n",
    "\n",
    "For the complete assignment and submission instructions, see:\n",

    "## Shallow water equations with radially symmetric dam break data\n",
    "\n",
    "The main point of this assignment is to get some more experience running Clawpack and producing plots. \n",
    "\n",
    "The code in this directory is similar to the one that produced the plots in Section 21.7.1 of FVMHP.  However, those plots (and all the other examples in the book) use gravitational constant $g=1$, corresponding to nondimensionalized variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a real-world problem we generally use physical coordinates, e.g. $h$ is measured in meters, and $u$ in m/s, in which case we should use $g=9.81$ m/s$^2$.  The code in this directory has been modified in that way, and also a more extreme jump in depth is imposed.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shows one approach to using Clawpack via a Jupyter notebook.  You could simply augment this notebook with additional cells to compute and display the results for the questions below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Or you can run clawpack at the command line as explained earlier and as you probably did for hw3.  In that case you will want to modify the Riemann data that is specified in `setrun.py`, run the code, make the plots, and save an appropriate frame of the solution to illustrate the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might want to try doing it both ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although you do not need to turn much in for this problem, produce the required plots to show that you got it working.  Also please spend some time studying the code to understand how things work and ask questions if you don't.  I hope that this will help you see how you might use Clawpack in the future for other problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some things to note as you inspect the code:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Riemann solvers specified in the `Makefile`s are from the Clawpack `riemann` repository, which you should have as part of Clawpack. You might want to see how the normal and transverse solvers are implemented.  You could first look at `$CLAW/riemann/src/rp1_shallow_roe_with_efix.f90` for the 1D version, which is used in the `1drad` code.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The 1D code in the `1drad` subdirectory use a fractional step method to solve the equations (21.37) with a radial source term.  You might want to look at how the `src1.f90` subroutine solves the ODEs in each cell using a 2-stage explicit Runge-Kutta method.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The 1D code imposes solid wall boundary conditions at the left boundary ($r=0$), which is the correct thing to do at the origin in this case.  Extrapolation BCs are used at the right boundary.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Extrapolation BCs are also imposed on the 2D problem, and note that the waves leave the domain with little spurious reflection at later times.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For fun, you might want to change to solid wall boundary conditions in the 2D problem and run out to later times to see how the waves bounce around in a closed container.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Common blocks are used for passing some parameters around rather than a Fortran 90 module as was done in the `psystem` example.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The subroutine `fdisc` specifies the location of the dam as the level set of a curve in 2D.   In `qinit.f90`, the library routine `cellave` is then used to compute the fraction of each grid cell that lies to the left or right of the curve specified by `fdisc`.  For fun you could try a non-radially symmetric dam.\n"
